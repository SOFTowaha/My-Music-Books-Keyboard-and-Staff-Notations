#####Octave register designations allow us to name a specific pitch. We say "C4" rather than just "C" when we
want to identify middle C. Shown above are the notes C1 through C7. All the pitches from one particular C up
to, but not including the next C, are in the same octave register. Note that ledger lines can be used to extend the
staff above or below. A "pitch class" includes all of the notes with a particular name. For example, "pitch class
C" refers to all of the pitches on the piano named C or that are enharmonic with C (such as B )
Please see the sections on major scales and minor scales for a discussion of accidentals and enharmonic notes.
