#####Octave register designations allow us to name a specific pitch. We say "C4" rather than just "C" when we
want to identify middle C. Shown above are the notes C1 through C7. All the pitches from one particular C up
to, but not including the next C, are in the same octave register. Note that ledger lines can be used to extend the
staff above or below. A "pitch class" includes all of the notes with a particular name. For example, "pitch class
C" refers to all of the pitches on the piano named C or that are enharmonic with C (such as B )
Please see the sections on major scales and minor scales for a discussion of accidentals and enharmonic notes.

If the bottom note on this keyboard were C4, all note names bracketed (regardless
of accidentals) would be in the same octave register (i.e. G4, B 4 and so forth).
