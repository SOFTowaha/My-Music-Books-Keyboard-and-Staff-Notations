###More Tips on Learning Notes:

 You can, if you do not have a keyboard or piano nearby, read the keyboard
notes without even playing. Look at their positions and remember what
they look like. Get it to memory.

 A very good skill when sight reading is recovering from mistakes. You will
make them. Don't let them fluster you; just keep playing. It is almost
guaranteed that if the listener isn't familiar with the music, and you don't
give it away, they'll never know.

 One of the hardest parts of sight reading music is getting the rhythm
correct. It helps to count out loud, "One and two and three and four and…"
Of course the numbers that you count depends on the piece.

 It helps to accompany a singer or other instrument while sight reading. This
forces you to stay honest.

 Check for sharps or flats, key changes, or changes in the time signature. If
you are dealing with any large jumps (i.e., octave jumps), also beware of
those. Double and triple check any note that isn't in the staff.

 Do not judge yourself or your ability as you sight read. Remember, you are
simply trying to improve your reading skills. Since sight reading keyboard
notes involves playing continuously (not stopping as if you were practicing
to perfect the piece), your focus is important. Getting angry at yourself
merely distracts you from the main goal. Smile and play with intent.

 Another very good (and far more enjoyable) way to practice sight reading is
to play duets with a friend, as both pianists will be forced to keep in time,
play continuously and with correct notes as far as possible.
