###Additional Tips to Piano Improvisation

As with anything to do with music, practicing is the key. Improvisation cannot be
completely spontaneous…it must build on a vocabulary of musical devices. These
can include small phrases of melody, rhythms, accompaniments, harmonic
progressions, and so on. The more expansive your vocabulary, the more your
music will become "your own."

Remember, to do this you should also listen to other people playing other pieces,
and listen to other people improvising too, so you get a feeling of how to
improvise. Experiment with playing measured rhythms (4/4 etc.) and completely
free rhythm. In free rhythm, there are no rules at all. You may find this helps you
come up with new ideas easier than trying to fit all your ideas into a particular
kind of rhythm. Record yourself early and often. Listen to these recordings.

When you're starting out, it may be difficult to remember things you played. If
you listen to your recordings, you may hear something cool you did that you
forgot. Then you can pick out that cool idea and use it again…thus helping to
build your musical vocabulary. Find a quiet spot with a window. This helps you to
be yourself and let what things you have cooped up inside flow out onto the keys.
Inspiration is many times found when viewing the beauty of the earth.

Relax and be loose with your fingers. If you mess up and accidentally hit a note
not in key, go with it and keep going in the new key, don't go back. (EXAMPLE:
Key of C–> you play C…E…G…A…F#…C#…D…<–now you're in the key of D) Vary
in volume, intensity, speed, and other dynamics to add emotion and beauty. Use
improvisation to let out your anger or soothe your worries. Play what your heart
tells you to play (cheesy, but true).

If you mess up, pretend it was a part of the song and keep going with it. Learn
music patterns. A harsh, short gliss gives the impression of anger and reproach.
Arpeggios in the bass voice tend to give a feeling of movement. Observe patterns
in speech and music and use those observations to your advantage.

* Do not feel you must learn tons about music theory "before" learning piano
Learn How to Play Piano Chords and More improvisation. It is sufficient to begin by learning maybe one scale and a
couple of chords within it…you can learn other chords/scales/theory with time!
