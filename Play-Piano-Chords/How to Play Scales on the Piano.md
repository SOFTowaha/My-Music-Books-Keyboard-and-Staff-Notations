###How to Play Scales on the Piano

* Your 5th finger should generally only be used for starting or ending a scale,
not passing tones. In other words, you should cross your 1st finger under
your 3rd or 4th finger, not the 5th.

* For a C scale, right hand example, you will play C, D, and E with fingers 1,
2, and 3, then pass finger 1 under the 3rd to play F, G, A, B, and C with 1,
2, 3, 4, and 5. Reverse this coming back down. (Note that ending on your
5th finger here is fine.)

* If you are continuing up more than one octave, you will cross your 1st
finger under the 4th, changing from B to C ready to start over with the
same pattern on the next octave.

* For the left hand going up, you want to cross your 3rd finger over your first
going from G to A. Continuing another octave, you'll cross your 4th over the
1st from C to D. It makes more sense to think of the mirrored fingerings,
but playing up with your right and down with your left is not the norm.
(Note that beginning on your 5th finger here is perfectly acceptable.)

* This crossing under fingers 3 and 4 (or over with fingers 3 and 4) may not
seem important on the all-white-keys C scale, but when you start working
on other keys, its importance becomes clear. Starting these good habits in
this easy scale will pay off in the long run. (In most keys, you will always
begin with your left hand on your 5th finger and end with your right hand
on your 5th finger.)

###Additional Tips:

* Use only the 5 fingers to play either C-D-E-F-G (right hand), or C-B-A-G-F
(left hand). Practice playing the notes going upward (to the right), then
downward (to the left) then both. After your fingers are loose enough, start
practicing going 10 notes up or down.


Starting to learn how to play keyboard or piano but finding it hard to improve?
Been taking piano lessons for some time now but feeling no progress? Or maybe
you have some piano experience but you need to improve your playing skills? In
this chapter, we'll be showing you how to improve your current piano skills.
The chapter takes into account people who learned playing by ear, using
instructional materials such as books and DVDs, or using lessons from a
professional teacher. So, if you feel that a certain step has already been
accomplished, go ahead and skip it to the next step. Dive in and enjoy learning
how to play keyboard and improving your playing skills!

###Things You'll Need to Improve Your Playing Skills:

* A piano or a digital piano. If you're going to use a digital piano or a
keyboard, make sure it's fully weighted with hammer-action capabilities
if possible.

* Piano lessons, for those intending to learn utilizing the experience and
knowledge of an instructor.
* A piano teaching media-set (such as DVD sets, books, videos, etc.) for
those intending to learn by themselves.
* A printer and some musical notation software is not a necessity but can
improve the process greatly.
* Time management software (simple spreadsheets applications are
enough in most cases) can benefit you greatly too.
* A serious commitment. Learning how to play keyboard or piano is not a
job that you can do in a week or two and be done with it. Improvements
are done in small steps not huge ones. Without commitment, you won't
be able to really improve.
