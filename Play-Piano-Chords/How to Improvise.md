###How to Improvise and More Tips

So what is piano improvisation and why might you want to learn it? The simple
definition of it is performing without preparation. Improvising can improve your
piano playing and the sound of your melody/music. It will change an ordinary
piece of music into an artful masterpiece! Below are some basics on several
different piano improvisation methods.

####Basic Steps to Piano Improvisation:

1. Have a knowledge of a variety of music, so as to not be imitating any one
song.

2. Learn about scales. Jump in and learn one that has a lot of sharps or flats in
it, such as B Major. Practice the scale, just in the right hand at first. You
might find these "bumpy" scales are easier to play than C major, since you
can "see" how the scale is shaped!

3. Learn about chords. It is suggested that you learn triad chords before
moving on to quartals and such. Triad chords consist of three notes (1-2-3)
and between two notes and the root(1-2 or 1-3) is a distinct interval. For a
quick example, a C major traid consists of a C-E-G. Between C-E is a major
3rd, while between C-G the interval is a perfect fifth.

4. There are as many ways to improvise as there are people. Here are some
suggested techniques to try… give them each a shot!

####Method One:

* Sit down and hit notes only of the same key. (F, G, Em, A#, etc.)

* Have your left hand play the background chorus (slow block or broken
chords) in the same key.

* Have your right hand playing the melody. Switch keys once you become
better at it to give it a broader, more complex feel and to amplify the
beauty of the song.

####Method Two:

* Play a slow 4/4 piece with each measure getting one chord on the left hand.
* With the right, improve a melody within that chord.
* The next measure switch to a different chord and continue the melody in that next chord. Continue this until you become proficient (or bored).

####Method Three:

* Once you've learned how to play some scales in both hands, try improvising
with both hands going at once.
* Get your fingers moving in the same scale…it'll sound alright. Try playing a
"question and answer" game with your hands.
* Play some random phrase in one hand and try to repeat it in your other
hand.
*  Start simple. Eventually you may find your hands can generate melodic
ideas simultaneously that work together!
* 

####Method Four:

* Instead of simply playing block chords or arpeggios in one hand, try to make the top or bottom note of that accompaniment form its own melody.
* The pinky and the thumb tend to be most convenient for this way of playing.
* Try playing accompaniments in your right hand with chords or arpeggios and melodies in your left hand.
