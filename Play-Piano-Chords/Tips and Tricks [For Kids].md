####How to Play Keyboard Notes[Also for Kids :P]

Assuming that you already have a basic knowledge of how to play keyboard or
piano, and are learning how to sight read the keyboard notes on the music
sheet, a few hints on how to learn to read notes might help. Just like in typing, do
not look down at your hands - reading the keyboard notes will become as second
nature as reading a book!

1.) Find music books at your local library, borrow books or print keyboard notes sheet 
music from a website at your skill level or easier. This should be music that you think  you would like but have never heard before.

2.) Sit at the keyboard or piano, and open the book to the first page. Look at the keyboard notes on the music sheet, say the notes softly, and learn to
understand the piece a little bit without actually playing any part of it. Look at the
key signature, any changes of clefs, and the dynamics of the pi ece. Look for
chords and try to determine what they are.
Look for the trickiest part of the piece and determine a speed at which you think
you can play even the trickiest parts. It is important to not stop and restart
when you make a mistake. Just keep playing. Look for patterns while you are
playing, and always try to read a minimum of one measure ahead.

3.) When you finish one piece, repeat it until you feel comfortable knowing the
names of the keyboard notes. Remember, it is like typing — your mind will tell
your fingers where to go once you practice it often enough.

4.) Continue with the same piece, and when the keyboard notes are easy to play,
learn the timing of the piece. No piece will sound good if the timing is incorrect.

5.) Keep practicing in this manner as often as you can. A few times a week is
best. Feel free to go back and study the pieces you played in more depth. The
more you practice, the better your sight reading skills will become.
