###How to Place Fingers Properly on the Keys

This chapter will guide you through the recommended proper finger placement on
the keyboard. Placing your fingers on the keys correctly right from the beginning
will make a big difference in learning piano, well and quickly.
First you will need to memorize the fingering number system. Fingers are
numbered to make it easier to write down finger placement on sheet music. It
also helps explaining proper keyboard finger placement. The numbering of fingers
is the same for both left and right hands. The numbering system is as follows:

 The thumb finger is number 1.

 The index finger is number 2.

 The middle finger is number 3.

 The ring finger is number 4.

 The pinky finger is number 5.

 Start at Middle C.

 Put finger 1 on the middle C note key.

 Put finger 2 on D, 3 on E, 4 on F, 5 on G. This is known as the Going up
pattern.

 Play the notes C-D-E-F-G using the current finger placement.

 Move finger 1 to the right, and below the other fingers just when your
finger 5 starts to go down to hit the G note key.

 Pass finger 1 under finger 5 to play the next A note.

 Repeat the five finger order outlined before so that finger 2 presses B, 3 on
C5, 4 on D5, and 5 on E5.

 Repeat the previous pattern until you reach the end of the keyboard.
