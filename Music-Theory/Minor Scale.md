###Minor Scales

There are three methods of constructing minor scales. The first and most tedious way is to count half steps
and whole steps (semitones and whole tones). This method is useful for demonstrating the exact layout of
a minor scale. However, the likelihood of making mistakes is increased.


There are three forms of minor scales: natural minor, harmonic minor, and melodic minor. The natural minor
scale features only the accidentals found in that scale's key signature, while both the harmonic and melodic
minor scales feature accidentals not found in the key signature. Melodic minor also features a descending
form of the scale in which the scale reverts to natural minor

The names of the scale degrees are exactly the same as they are for major scales with one exception.
In natural minor, scale degree 7 is referred to as the "subtonic." In harmonic and melodic minor the seventh
scale degree is a half step below the tonic and is called the "leading tone" as it is in major scales.

The second way of constructing minor scales is to take the parallel major of that scale and then alter
certain scale degrees. Parallel major/minor scales (keys) are scales that have the SAME tonic but
DIFFERENT key signatures. For example, if a c minor scale is needed, construct a C major scale
and then alter scale degrees 3, 6, and 7 as needed.

Below is a C major scale. If a c natural minor scale is desired, then scale degrees 3, 6, and 7 of the
C major scale should be lowered by a half step (semitone).

If a c harmonic minor scale is needed, scale degrees 3 and 6 should be lowered by a half step, leaving
scale degree 7 untouched.

If a melodic minor scale (ascending) is wanted, then only scale degree 3 should be lowered by a
single half step.

Remember -- a natural note (white key note on the piano) is raised a half step by using a sharp  and
lowered a half step by using a flat. A note that is already modified by a flat is further lowered
a half step with a double flat  and raised a half step with a natural . A note that is already modified
by a sharp  is lowered a half step with a natural and raised a half step with a double sharp.

Remember that melodic minor in its descending form is simply the natural minor scale.

The third way of constructing a minor scale utilizes the concept of "relative" major and minor keys.
Relative major/minor scales (keys) are scales that have the SAME key signature but DIFFERENT tonics.

For example, if you are asked to construct a g natural minor scale, you need merely to find the key signature
of its relative major. Finding relative keys is easy. If you are presented with the minor tonic (in this case
g), you need to go UP three half steps (semitones) or a m3 (see section on intervals) to find the tonic of its
relative major. 
If you need to find the relative minor of a given major tonic, then you must go DOWN three
half steps (semitones) or a m3 from the tonic of the given major. This note is also scale degree 6 of the given
major scale. Please see the bottom of this page for a discussion of enharmonic note spellings.

B major's key signature includes 2 flats; therefore, the key signature for g minor has the same 2 flats.
The same reasoning holds for the key of C major and a minor, both of which have no sharps or flats in
the key signature

B major is the relative major of g minor

If you need to construct an harmonic minor scale, follow the steps above and then raise scale degree 7 by one
half step (semitone).

If you need to construct a melodic minor scale (ascending form), follow the above steps and then raise
scale degrees 6 and 7 by one half step (semitone)

*Enharmonic Spellings*
The third scale degree of a given minor scale is also the tonic of its relative major, and the sixth scale degree
of a given major scale is also the tonic of its relative minor. It is important to go up 3 letter names when
counting the half steps in order to avoid spelling a key enharmonically (in this example C = the 1st letter
name, D = the 2nd letter name, and E = the 3rd letter name). Enharmonic notes sound the same and share
the same piano key but have different spellings. For example, E and D share the same pitch and the same
piano key but not the same spelling. E major (NOT D major) is the relative major of c minor. Because
relative keys have the same key signatures, they will either both have sharps or both have flats.
C minor is the relative minor of Eb major
