###Minor Scales

There are three methods of constructing minor scales. The first and most tedious way is to count half steps
and whole steps (semitones and whole tones). This method is useful for demonstrating the exact layout of
a minor scale. However, the likelihood of making mistakes is increased.


There are three forms of minor scales: natural minor, harmonic minor, and melodic minor. The natural minor
scale features only the accidentals found in that scale's key signature, while both the harmonic and melodic
minor scales feature accidentals not found in the key signature. Melodic minor also features a descending
form of the scale in which the scale reverts to natural minor

The names of the scale degrees are exactly the same as they are for major scales with one exception.
In natural minor, scale degree 7 is referred to as the "subtonic." In harmonic and melodic minor the seventh
scale degree is a half step below the tonic and is called the "leading tone" as it is in major scales.
