This is the circle of fifths. By reading this chart clockwise, you will notice that the tonic of each new key
is a P5 (see section on intervals) above the tonic of the previous key. In other words, each key starts on the
dominant scale degree of the previous key. G is the fifth scale degree (dominant) in C major. G is also the
next key on the circle of fifths.

By reading this chart counter-clockwise, you will notice that the tonic of each new key is a P5 below the
tonic of the previous key. In other words, each key starts on the subdominant scale degree of the previous
key. F is the fourth scale degree (subdominant) in C major. F is also the next key on the circle of fifths.
Notice also the enharmonic keys at the bottom of this chart. The Circle of Fifths should be memorized.
