###Major Scales

All major scales have the same pattern of half steps and whole steps that conform to the following example.
The half step (semitone) is the smallest interval in tonal music. Any two piano keys that are next to one
another are a half step apart. This pattern is most commonly a white key to a black key, but the white key
notes E to F and B to C are also half steps. A whole step (whole tone) is simply two half steps

Scale Degree Names in Major Keys:
* 1= Tonic
* 2 = Supertonic
* 3 = Mediant
* 4 = Subdominant
* 5 = Dominant
* 6 = Submediant
* 7 = Leading Tone

In order to construct major scales on other tonics we need to use accidentals.
* (sharp) raises a pitch by a half step
* (flat) lowers a pitch by a half step
* (natural) cancels an accidental (refers to white keys on piano)
* (double sharp) raises a pitch by a whole step
* (double flat) lowers a pitch by a whole step

Scales are always named for the tonic note, in this case D .
Key signatures are derived from the accidentals required to make a scale on a given note. Key signatures,
like scales, are named after the tonic. In other words, the key of D major has D as its tonic. While it is
important to understand and be able to apply the pattern of half steps and whole steps in creating major
scales, it is also important to memorize all of the key signatures for the major and minor scales.


Flats and sharps appear in key signatures in a predictable manner. This order of flats and sharps is as
follows: Order of flats = BEADGCF Order of sharps = FCGDAEB
For example, if a key signature has two flats, they will be B and E, and if a key signature has 3 sharps,
they will be F, C, and G
