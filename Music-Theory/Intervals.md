###Intervals

An interval is the distance between two notes. Intervals can either be harmonic (played at the same time)
or melodic (played successively).

Intervals are identified by a number and a modifier. The half step (semitone) is the smallest interval in tonal
music. Any two piano keys that are next to one another are a half step apart. This pattern is most commonly
a white key to a black key, but the white key notes E to F and B to C are also half steps.

* Interval modifiers include perfect (P), major (M), minor (m), augmented (+), and diminished (ยบ).
* Intervals that can be perfect = 1, 4, 5, and 8. (1= unison and 8 = octave)
* Intervals that can be major = 2, 3, 6, and 7.
* Intervals that can be minor = 2, 3, 6, and 7.
* Any interval can be augmented, and any interval can be diminished.

*Identification of Intervals*

* 1) Count the interval's numerical name. Start on the bottom note and call it "1" and continue to the top note.
Do not skip a note name. In the following example, C =1, D = 2, E = 3, F= 4, G = 5, and A = 6. The numerical
name for this interval is a 6th

* 2) Think of the key of the bottom note. Is the note "A" the normal sixth scale degree in C major?
Yes it is, which makes this a M6
It is important to memorize the intervals contained in the major scale.

* Perfect intervals made larger by a half step (semitone) become augmented (i.e. P5 becomes an +5)
* Perfect intervals made smaller by a half step (semitone) become diminished (i.e. P5 becomes a ยบ5)
* Major intervals made larger by a half step (semitone) become augmented (i.e. M3 becomes an +3)
* Major intervals made smaller by a half step (semitone) become minor (i.e. M3 becomes a m3)
* Minor intervals made smaller by a half step (semitone) become diminished (i.e. m3 becomes a ยบ3)
* Minor intervals made larger by a half step (semitone) become major (i.e. m2 becomes a M2)
