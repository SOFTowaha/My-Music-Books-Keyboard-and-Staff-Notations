###Intervals

An interval is the distance between two notes. Intervals can either be harmonic (played at the same time)
or melodic (played successively).

Intervals are identified by a number and a modifier. The half step (semitone) is the smallest interval in tonal
music. Any two piano keys that are next to one another are a half step apart. This pattern is most commonly
a white key to a black key, but the white key notes E to F and B to C are also half steps.

* Interval modifiers include perfect (P), major (M), minor (m), augmented (+), and diminished (ยบ).
* Intervals that can be perfect = 1, 4, 5, and 8. (1= unison and 8 = octave)
* Intervals that can be major = 2, 3, 6, and 7.
* Intervals that can be minor = 2, 3, 6, and 7.
* Any interval can be augmented, and any interval can be diminished.
