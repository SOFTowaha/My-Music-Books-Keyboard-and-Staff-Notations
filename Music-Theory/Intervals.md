###Intervals

An interval is the distance between two notes. Intervals can either be harmonic (played at the same time)
or melodic (played successively).

Intervals are identified by a number and a modifier. The half step (semitone) is the smallest interval in tonal
music. Any two piano keys that are next to one another are a half step apart. This pattern is most commonly
a white key to a black key, but the white key notes E to F and B to C are also half steps.

* Interval modifiers include perfect (P), major (M), minor (m), augmented (+), and diminished (ยบ).
* Intervals that can be perfect = 1, 4, 5, and 8. (1= unison and 8 = octave)
* Intervals that can be major = 2, 3, 6, and 7.
* Intervals that can be minor = 2, 3, 6, and 7.
* Any interval can be augmented, and any interval can be diminished.

*Identification of Intervals*

* 1) Count the interval's numerical name. Start on the bottom note and call it "1" and continue to the top note.
Do not skip a note name. In the following example, C =1, D = 2, E = 3, F= 4, G = 5, and A = 6. The numerical
name for this interval is a 6th

* 2) Think of the key of the bottom note. Is the note "A" the normal sixth scale degree in C major?
Yes it is, which makes this a M6
It is important to memorize the intervals contained in the major scale.

* Perfect intervals made larger by a half step (semitone) become augmented (i.e. P5 becomes an +5)
* Perfect intervals made smaller by a half step (semitone) become diminished (i.e. P5 becomes a ยบ5)
* Major intervals made larger by a half step (semitone) become augmented (i.e. M3 becomes an +3)
* Major intervals made smaller by a half step (semitone) become minor (i.e. M3 becomes a m3)
* Minor intervals made smaller by a half step (semitone) become diminished (i.e. m3 becomes a ยบ3)
* Minor intervals made larger by a half step (semitone) become major (i.e. m2 becomes a M2)

This is a list of commonly encountered intervals. This list is NOT exhaustive.
Interval name # of half steps (semitones)

* P1 = 0 (unison)
* m2 = 1
* M2 = 2
* +2 = 3
* m3 = 3
* M3 = 4
* P4 = 5
* +4 = 6 (tritone)
* ยบ5 = 6 (tritone)
* P5 = 7
* m6 = 8
* M6 = 9
* +6 = 10
* m7 = 10
* M7 = 11
* P8 = 12 (octave)

Just as there are enharmonic spellings for notes, there are enharmonic intervals as well


The +6 sounds the same as a m7 but is spelled differently. An +6 above C is an A#, while a m7 above C
is a Bb. A# and Bb are enharmonic and are both 10 half steps (semitones) above C, but one is counted
as a sixth and the other as a seventh.

Doubly diminished and doubly augmented intervals are possible but are not commonly encountered. We will
not consider them during this course

How to write an interval ABOVE a given note.
* Example: Write a m6 above the given note.

* 1) Find the note a sixth above E, using E as 1. The note a sixth above E is a C
![C](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4376131/8403583/e16f004c-1e67-11e5-98d9-70ce5f112e71.JPG)

* 2) Think in the key of the bottom note (E major). C# is the sixth scale degree in the key of E major. C# is
therefore a M6 above C. C is a m6 above C

Sometimes you will be asked to write an interval above a note that is the tonic of an unusual key, such as F .
You should temporarily remove the accidental and then add it back when you have determined the interval.
* Example: Write a P5 above F 
![P5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4376131/8403586/e17eab82-1e67-11e5-97aa-923d065185fa.JPG)

* 1) Remove the flat so that you are now thinking in the key of F. A P5 above F is C. When you add the flat
back to the F, you must also add a flat to the C to maintain the P5.

This is how to write an interval BELOW a given note.
A good way to write an interval below a given note is to first invert the interval and find this inversion above
the given note. After this note is found, you will then place it an octave lower thus putting the note
below the given pitch.

Inversion of an interval happens when the bottom pitch is placed above the top pitch (or the top pitch is
placed below the bottom pitch). To find the inversion of an interval, subtract the number of the interval
from 9. The number 9 is a constant value -- the sum of an interval and its inversion will always add up to 9.
The following should be memorized:

* 7ths invert to 2nds (and vice versa)
* 6ths invert to 3rds (and vice versa)
* 5ths invert to 4ths (and vice versa)
* major intervals become minor
* minor intervals become major
* perfect intervals remain perfect
* diminished intervals become augmented
* augmented intervals become diminished

* Example: find the inversion of a m6
* 
9-6 = 3, so the inversion of a m6 is some kind of 3rd. Furthermore, minor intervals invert to major intervals,
so a m6 inverts to a M3.

* Example: Write a P4 below the given note:
